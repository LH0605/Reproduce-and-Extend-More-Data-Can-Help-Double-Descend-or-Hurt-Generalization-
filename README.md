# README

This repo serves as the reimplementation and extension for the paper [The Curious Case of Adversarially Robust Models: More Data Can Help, Double Descend, or Hurt Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11080).

Reports of all our experiments can be found in the Contribution folder.\
“Reproducability Report” reproduces all the results of the original paper. \
"Extension_notebook" summarizes the results of all our extension experiments with multi-dimensional data and various different attacks. \
"Extension_report" is the sum of all our extension ideas.
All remaining python files are experimental models.
